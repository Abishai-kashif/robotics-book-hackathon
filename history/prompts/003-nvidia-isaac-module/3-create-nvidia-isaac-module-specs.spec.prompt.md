## Prompt

Create content-writing specs for Module 3 — "Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)", matching the structure and depth of Modules 1 & 2 specs. The specs must explicitly require that generated content is written directly into each corresponding chapter file of Module 3 (e.g., docs/nvidia-isaac-platform.md).

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive specification for Module 3 content research & production focused on NVIDIA Isaac™ platform. The spec includes user scenarios, functional requirements, key entities, and success criteria that match the structure and depth of Modules 1 & 2. The spec explicitly requires that all generated content be written directly into corresponding chapter files in the docs directory. Also created a validation checklist to ensure spec quality.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete specification for Module 3 content development with NVIDIA Isaac™ focus
- 🧪 Tests: Validated spec against quality checklist requirements
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md and requirements checklist in 003-nvidia-isaac-module directory
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for clarification (/sp.clarify) or planning (/sp.plan) phases
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully followed established pattern from Modules 1 & 2 while focusing on NVIDIA Isaac™ platform requirements

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - Spec meets all quality criteria
- Prompt variant (if applicable):
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin planning phase for Module 3 content development
