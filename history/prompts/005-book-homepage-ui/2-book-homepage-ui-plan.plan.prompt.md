# Plan Book Homepage UI Implementation

## PROMPT_TEXT

/sp.plan

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Successfully completed the implementation planning for the Book Homepage UI feature. Created all required artifacts:

1. Implementation plan (plan.md) - Technical approach for replacing Docusaurus default homepage with book-relevant UI
2. Research document (research.md) - Analysis of Docusaurus customization options, best practices, and implementation strategy
3. Data model (data-model.md) - Defined entities for book information, modules, navigation, and component state
4. Quickstart guide (quickstart.md) - Step-by-step implementation guide for developers
5. Contracts directory - Documentation explaining frontend contracts for static site

The plan follows Docusaurus best practices while creating an educational-focused homepage that emphasizes the textbook's academic content. All constitution checks passed, confirming the approach uses standard web technologies with appropriate complexity for the task.
