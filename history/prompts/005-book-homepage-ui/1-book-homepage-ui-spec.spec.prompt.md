# Create Book Homepage UI Specification

## PROMPT_TEXT

Write specifications to update the homepage so it displays a book-relevant UI instead of the default Docusaurus template.

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Created a comprehensive specification for updating the homepage to display a book-relevant UI instead of the default Docusaurus template. The specification includes:

- User scenarios with P1, P2, and P3 priorities
- Clear acceptance scenarios for each user story
- Functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-006)
- Key entities related to homepage layout and navigation
- Success criteria with measurable outcomes (SC-001 through SC-004)

The specification follows the template structure and focuses on user value without implementation details. A quality checklist was also created and validated, confirming all requirements are testable and unambiguous.
