# Module 2 Quality Assurance Checklist

## Overview

This checklist is designed to ensure that all Module 2 content meets academic standards and maintains consistency with Module 1. Use this checklist to validate each chapter before finalizing it.

## Content Quality Standards

### Academic Rigor
- [ ] Content meets university-level academic standards
- [ ] All technical information is accurate and up-to-date
- [ ] Concepts are explained clearly with appropriate depth
- [ ] Learning objectives are specific, measurable, and achievable
- [ ] Content aligns with learning objectives and exercises

### Physical AI Focus
- [ ] All content connects to Physical AI principles
- [ ] Emphasizes the connection between digital intelligence and physical action
- [ ] Demonstrates embodied intelligence concepts
- [ ] Maintains focus on humanoid robotics applications

### ROS 2 Integration
- [ ] Where applicable, content includes ROS 2 examples
- [ ] Follows rclpy patterns for Python integration
- [ ] Demonstrates proper node, topic, and service usage
- [ ] Maintains consistency with Module 1 ROS 2 concepts

### Simulation-to-Reality
- [ ] Content starts with simulation examples
- [ ] Demonstrates concepts in simulation before real-world applications
- [ ] Provides clear path from simulation to physical implementation
- [ ] Maintains consistency with Module 1 simulation approach

## Structure and Format

### Required Sections
- [ ] Frontmatter includes title, description, and sidebar_position
- [ ] Learning objectives are clearly stated (3-5 specific objectives)
- [ ] Prerequisites reference specific Module 1 content
- [ ] Content follows logical progression from basic to advanced concepts
- [ ] Examples demonstrate practical application of concepts
- [ ] Exercises align with learning objectives
- [ ] Summary recaps key concepts
- [ ] References include at least 5 authoritative academic sources

### Formatting Consistency
- [ ] Consistent heading hierarchy (H1 for title, H2 for sections, etc.)
- [ ] Proper use of bold, italic, and code formatting
- [ ] Consistent terminology with Module 1
- [ ] Proper code block formatting with language specification
- [ ] Consistent link formatting and accuracy

## Cross-Module Connections

### Module 1 Integration
- [ ] Each chapter references at least one specific Module 1 concept
- [ ] Clearly indicates how Module 2 content builds upon Module 1
- [ ] Maintains consistent terminology with Module 1
- [ ] Provides navigation aids for students moving between modules
- [ ] Connection to Module 1 is explicitly mentioned in examples

### Content Progression
- [ ] Content appropriately increases in complexity from Module 1
- [ ] Prerequisites are clearly stated and appropriate
- [ ] Builds logically on concepts introduced in Module 1
- [ ] Maintains accessibility while advancing complexity

## Technical Validation

### Code Examples
- [ ] Code examples follow Module 1 patterns where applicable
- [ ] Code is properly formatted with syntax highlighting
- [ ] Code examples are realistic and executable
- [ ] Code includes appropriate comments and explanations

### References and Citations
- [ ] All references include author, year, and source
- [ ] At least 5 academic references per chapter
- [ ] References are authoritative and relevant to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics
- [ ] Citation format is consistent throughout
- [ ] Links to ROS 2 documentation where applicable

## Quality Assurance Process

### Self-Review Steps
1. Read through the entire chapter to ensure logical flow
2. Verify all learning objectives are addressed
3. Check all examples for accuracy and relevance
4. Validate exercises against learning objectives
5. Confirm all Module 1 connections are properly established
6. Review references for quality and relevance

### Peer Review Requirements
- [ ] Another contributor has reviewed the content
- [ ] Feedback from peer review has been incorporated
- [ ] Technical accuracy has been verified by subject matter expert

### Final Validation
- [ ] Content passes automated validation script
- [ ] All checklist items are marked as complete
- [ ] Chapter has been tested in the Docusaurus environment
- [ ] All links and cross-references work correctly
