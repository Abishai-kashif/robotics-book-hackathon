# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

Welcome to the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** textbook. This comprehensive guide bridges the gap between digital AI and physical robots, focusing on embodied intelligence.

## Course Overview

The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This capstone course introduces **Physical AI**—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. Students learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions using ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac.

### Learning Objectives

- Understand Physical AI principles and embodied intelligence
- Master ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) for robotic control
- Simulate robots with Gazebo and Unity
- Develop with NVIDIA Isaac AI robot platform
- Design humanoid robots for natural interactions
- Integrate GPT models for conversational robotics

### Course Structure

This textbook is organized into four main modules:

1. **Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)**: Middleware for robot control, nodes, topics, and services
2. **Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)**: Physics simulation and environment building
3. **AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)**: Advanced perception and training
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: Convergence of LLMs and Robotics

The course concludes with a capstone project where you'll build an autonomous humanoid robot that can receive voice commands, plan paths, navigate obstacles, identify objects, and manipulate them.

## Getting Started

To begin your journey in Physical AI, start with understanding the foundations of embodied intelligence in the next section, then proceed through each module sequentially to build comprehensive knowledge of humanoid robotics.
