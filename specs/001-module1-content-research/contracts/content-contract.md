1. **Title** (h1) - Clear, descriptive title for the chapter
2. **Learning Objectives** (section) - 2-5 specific, measurable objectives
3. **Introduction** (section) - Overview connecting to previous knowledge
4. **Key Concepts** (section) - Main content organized in subsections
5. **Practical Examples** (section) - At least 1 practical implementation
6. **Exercises** (section) - 2-5 problems or tasks for students
7. **Summary** (section) - Key takeaways and connections to next topic
8. **References** (section) - Academic and technical sources
