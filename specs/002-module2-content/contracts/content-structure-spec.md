# Content Structure Specification: Module 2

## Overview

This specification defines the structure and requirements for Module 2 content in the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. It ensures consistency with Module 1 while allowing for appropriate advancement in complexity.

## Chapter Structure

Each Module 2 chapter must follow this structure:

### Required Frontmatter
```yaml
---
title: Chapter X - [Chapter Title]
description: [Brief description of the chapter content]
sidebar_position: X
---
```

### Required Sections
1. **Title** - Clear, descriptive chapter title
2. **Learning Objectives** - 3-5 specific, measurable objectives
3. **Prerequisites** - Required knowledge from Module 1 or earlier chapters
4. **Content Sections** - Main educational content organized logically
5. **Examples** - Practical examples with code/implementation where applicable
6. **Exercises** - 2-5 exercises of varying difficulty
7. **Summary** - Brief recap of key concepts
8. **References** - Academic sources and citations

## Content Requirements

### Learning Objectives
- Must be specific, measurable, and achievable
- Should build upon concepts from Module 1
- Must align with the chapter's content and exercises

### Prerequisites
- Must reference specific Module 1 chapters or concepts
- Should indicate what knowledge is required to understand the chapter
- May reference earlier Module 2 chapters if applicable

### Content Sections
- Must follow a logical progression from basic to advanced concepts
- Should include clear headings and subheadings
- Must connect to Physical AI and humanoid robotics principles
- Should include ROS 2 examples where appropriate
- Must start with simulation examples before real-world concepts

### Examples
- Should demonstrate practical application of concepts
- May include code snippets following Module 1 patterns
- Must reference related Module 1 content when building upon it
- Should illustrate Physical AI principles in action

### Exercises
- Should include a mix of theoretical and practical problems
- Must align with learning objectives
- Should vary in difficulty (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced)
- May require students to extend Module 1 concepts

### References
- Must include at least 5 authoritative academic sources
- Should cite relevant research in Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics
- Must follow consistent citation format
- Should include links to ROS 2 documentation when applicable

## Cross-Module Connections

### Required Connections to Module 1
- Each chapter must reference at least one specific Module 1 concept
- Should clearly indicate how Module 2 content builds upon Module 1
- Must maintain consistent terminology with Module 1
- Should provide navigation aids for students moving between modules

### Connection Patterns
1. **Extension**: How Module 2 extends Module 1 concepts
2. **Application**: How Module 1 theory applies in Module 2 practice
3. **Comparison**: How Module 2 approaches differ from Module 1
4. **Prerequisite**: What Module 1 knowledge is required

## Quality Standards

### Academic Rigor
- Content must meet university-level academic standards
- All technical information must be accurate and up-to-date
- Concepts must be explained clearly with appropriate depth

### Physical AI Focus
- All content must connect to Physical AI principles
- Must emphasize the connection between digital intelligence and physical action
- Should demonstrate embodied intelligence concepts

### ROS 2 Integration
- Where applicable, content must include ROS 2 examples
- Must follow rclpy patterns for Python integration
- Should demonstrate proper node, topic, and service usage

### Simulation-to-Reality
- Content must start with simulation examples
- Should demonstrate concepts in simulation before real-world applications
- Must provide clear path from simulation to physical implementation
