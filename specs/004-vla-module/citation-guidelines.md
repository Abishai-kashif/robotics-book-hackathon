# Citation and Reference Format Guidelines for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems

## Overview
This document establishes the citation and reference format guidelines for Module 4 content on Vision-Language-Action systems. These guidelines ensure consistency with academic standards and previous modules while accommodating the specific types of sources relevant to VLA research.

## General Citation Principles

### Academic Standards
- All claims requiring support must be cited with authoritative sources
- Prefer peer-reviewed research papers, technical documentation, and official standards
- Ensure all citations are accessible to students and researchers
- Maintain consistency in citation style throughout all Module 4 content

### Source Hierarchy
1. **Primary sources**: Peer-reviewed journal articles and conference papers
2. **Secondary sources**: Technical reports, thesis/dissertations, books
3. **Tertiary sources**: Official documentation, standards, authoritative websites
4. **Supplementary sources**: Blog posts, tutorials (only when primary sources unavailable)

## In-Text Citation Format

### Narrative Citations
- For single author: (Author, Year) or Author (Year) showed that...
- For two authors: (Author & Author, Year) or Authors (Year) demonstrated...
- For three or more authors: (Author et al., Year) or Authors et al. (Year) found that...

### Parenthetical Citations
- Include author(s) and year: (Author, Year)
- For multiple sources: (Author1, Year1; Author2, Year2)
- Include page numbers when directly quoting: (Author, Year, p. #)

## Specific VLA System Source Categories

### Vision-Language Model Papers
- Prioritize papers from top-tier conferences (CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR)
- Include model architecture details and performance metrics
- Cite original papers rather than blog posts when available

### Robotics and ROS 2 Sources
- Cite official ROS 2 documentation and design articles
- Include package names and versions for code examples
- Reference relevant standards (e.g., REP documents)

### Simulation Environment Documentation
- Cite official documentation for Gazebo, Isaac Sim, etc.
- Include version numbers and configuration details
- Reference relevant tutorials and examples

### Dataset References
- Include dataset creators, title, publication year, and access information
- Specify version or release used in experiments
- Include statistics about dataset size and composition

## Quality Requirements for Sources

### Authority Criteria
- Peer-reviewed publications from recognized venues
- Official documentation from established organizations
- Technical reports from reputable institutions
- Author credentials and institutional affiliations

### Currency Guidelines
- Prioritize recent publications (within 5 years) for rapidly evolving fields
- Accept older foundational papers that established key concepts
- For tutorials and documentation, use most recent versions
- Clearly indicate when citing outdated but historically important work

### Accessibility Standards
- Ensure all cited sources are accessible to students
- Prefer open-access publications when available
- For paywalled content, ensure institutional access is likely
- Include DOI or persistent URL when available

## Reference List Format

### General Rules
- Alphabetize by first author's last name
- Use hanging indent for multi-line entries
- Include complete bibliographic information
- Ensure all in-text citations appear in the reference list

### Special Cases

#### Multiple works by same author in same year
- Use lowercase letters after year: (Author, Yeara, Yearb)
- List in reference list as: Author, A. A. (Yeara)...
                        Author, A. A. (Yearb)...

#### Corporate authors
- Treat organization name as author: (NVIDIA Corporation, 2022)
- In alphabetization, use first significant word of organization name

#### No author
- Use title of work in place of author in both in-text and reference list
- Begin reference entry with the title

## Verification Requirements

### Source Verification
- Verify that all cited sources exist and are accessible
- Check that URLs and DOIs are functional
- Confirm that page numbers and volume numbers are accurate
- Ensure author names and affiliations are correctly spelled

### Academic Appropriateness
- Verify that sources meet academic standards for university-level content
- Ensure sources are relevant to the specific topic being discussed
- Check that sources are not outdated for the claims being made
- Confirm that sources support the specific claims being made
