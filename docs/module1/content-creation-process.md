- Identify authoritative sources (minimum 5 per chapter)
- Verify currency of sources (preferably within 5 years)
- Document source quality ratings and relevance

#### 1.3 Template and Structure Definition
- Apply standardized chapter template
- Define learning objectives format
- Establish content section requirements
- Create exercise and example frameworks

### Phase 2: Content Development (4-6 weeks)

#### 2.1 Chapter Creation Process
- Follow the 8-section chapter template:
  1. Learning Objectives
  2. Introduction
  3. Key Concepts (minimum 3 detailed concepts)
  4. Practical Examples (minimum 1 complete example)
  5. Exercises (2-5 problems of varying difficulty)
  6. Summary
  7. References
  8. Constitution Compliance Check

#### 2.2 Quality Standards Implementation
- Ensure minimum 1,500 words per chapter
- Include at least 3 key concepts with detailed explanations
- Provide 1+ complete practical examples with code
- Create 2-5 exercises with answer guides
- Verify constitutional compliance at each stage

#### 2.3 Technical Validation
- Test all code examples in appropriate environments
- Verify URDF models and simulation compatibility
- Validate mathematical concepts and calculations
- Confirm ROS 2 implementation accuracy

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance (1-2 weeks)

#### 3.1 Peer Review Process
- Technical accuracy review by subject matter experts
- Pedagogical effectiveness review by education specialists
- Constitutional compliance verification
- Academic standards confirmation

#### 3.2 Content Consistency Checks
- Terminology consistency across chapters
- Formatting standardization
- Academic rigor verification
- Learning objective alignment

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing (1 week)

#### 4.1 Module Integration
- Verify chapter-to-chapter coherence
- Test cross-references and dependencies
- Validate navigation and user experience
- Confirm Docusaurus build compatibility

#### 4.2 Assessment Integration
- Align assessments with learning objectives
- Verify exercise difficulty progression
- Test practical application components
- Validate grading rubrics

## Constitutional Compliance Process

### 8-Point Verification Checklist
Each chapter must pass all constitutional requirements:

1. **Physical AI First**: Content connects AI systems to the physical world
2. **ROS 2 Integration**: Robotic concepts use ROS 2 as middleware
3. **Sim2Real**: Includes simulation examples before real-world concepts
4. **Multi-Platform**: Supports NVIDIA Isaac, Gazebo, Unity platforms
5. **Vision-Language-Action**: Integrates LLMs, computer vision, robotic action
6. **Humanoid-Centric**: Prioritizes humanoid form factors and environments
7. **Conversational AI**: Includes GPT models or conversational components
8. **Hardware-Aware**: Acknowledges computational demands

### Verification Steps
- Self-assessment by content creator
- Independent verification by compliance reviewer
- Technical validation by subject matter expert
- Final sign-off by module lead
