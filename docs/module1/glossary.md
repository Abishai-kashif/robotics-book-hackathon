# Module 1 Glossary: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## A

**Affordances**: Action possibilities that the environment offers to an agent. In Physical AI, understanding environmental affordances is crucial for intelligent behavior, allowing the agent to identify and exploit opportunities for interaction with the physical world.

**Anthropomorphic Design**: Design approach that incorporates human-like characteristics, proportions, or features. In humanoid robotics, this refers to creating robots with human-like form factors and interaction capabilities.

## B

**Balance Control**: The process of maintaining a robot's center of mass within its support polygon to prevent falls. Critical for humanoid robots during static and dynamic activities.

**Biomechanics**: The study of mechanical laws relating to the movement or structure of living organisms. In humanoid robotics, biomechanics refers to understanding and replicating human movement patterns and physical constraints.

**Bipedal Locomotion**: Two-legged walking or movement pattern. A fundamental challenge in humanoid robotics requiring sophisticated balance and control algorithms.

## C

**Constitution Compliance**: Adherence to the 8 core principles of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics constitution, including Physical AI First, ROS 2 Integration, Simulation-to-Reality, Multi-Platform Compatibility, Vision-Language-Action Integration, Humanoid-Centric Design, Conversational AI Integration, and Hardware-Aware Content Delivery.

## D

**Domain Randomization**: A technique that involves training AI systems in simulations with randomly varied parameters to improve their ability to generalize to real-world conditions. By exposing the system to a wide range of simulated conditions, it becomes more robust to the reality gap.

## E

**Embodied Intelligence**: The principle that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment. Unlike traditional AI systems that process information in isolation, embodied systems must continuously adapt to the physical constraints and opportunities presented by their surroundings.

**Embodiment**: The concept that cognitive processes are shaped by the physical form and environmental interactions of an agent. In robotics, this refers to how a robot's physical form influences its behavior and intelligence.

## H

**Human-Centered Design**: Design approach that focuses on the needs, wants, and limitations of end users. In humanoid robotics, this involves creating robots that operate effectively in human environments with appropriate sizing, proportions, and interaction mechanisms.

**Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)**: The field of study focusing on interactions between humans and robots. Encompasses multi-modal communication, social signals, and collaborative behaviors.

**Humanoid Robot**: A robot with human-like form and capabilities, designed to operate in human environments and interact naturally with humans.

**Humanoid Robotics**: The branch of robotics focused on developing robots with human-like form, behavior, and capabilities for operation in human environments.

## L

**Learning Objectives**: Specific, measurable statements that describe what students will be able to do after completing a chapter or module. Should be achievable and aligned with course goals.

## M

**Middleware**: Software that provides common services and capabilities to applications beyond what's offered by the operating system. In robotics, middleware like ROS 2 facilitates communication between different software components.

**Multi-Modal Interaction**: Interaction that utilizes multiple communication channels such as speech, gesture, facial expressions, and touch. Essential for natural human-robot communication.

## P

**Perception-Action Loop**: A continuous cycle where sensory input informs action selection, and the consequences of actions provide new sensory input. Fundamental to how robots interact with the physical world.

**Physical AI**: A paradigm that connects digital AI algorithms with physical robot hardware, enabling intelligent systems to perceive, reason about, and act upon the physical world. Emphasizes the critical relationship between digital intelligence and physical embodiment.

**Physical Embodiment**: The physical form and structure of an intelligent agent, which constrains and enables certain behaviors and interactions with the environment.

**Physics-Based Reasoning**: The use of physics principles and models to predict the consequences of actions and understand the behavior of objects in the environment. Crucial for tasks like grasping, navigation, and manipulation.

**Physics Simulation**: Computational modeling of physical phenomena including forces, friction, collisions, and dynamics to create realistic virtual environments for robot development and testing.

## Q

**Quality of Service (QoS)**: In ROS 2, policies that allow fine-tuning of communication characteristics based on specific requirements for reliability, latency, and bandwidth in robotic applications.

## R

**ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)**: The middleware that enables communication between different software components in robotic systems. Provides the essential infrastructure for connecting digital AI algorithms with physical robot hardware.

**ROS 2 Architecture**: The distributed system design of ROS 2 using Data Distribution Service (DDS) for communication between nodes, enabling real-time data exchange between perception, planning, and control components.

## S

**Sim2Real (Simulation-to-Reality)**: The approach of developing and testing robotic algorithms in simulation before deployment on physical robots, addressing the "reality gap" between virtual and physical environments.

**Simulation-to-Reality Transfer**: The process of transferring behaviors, controllers, or learned policies from simulation to real robots, requiring techniques to address differences between simulated and real environments.

## T

**Topics**: In ROS 2, a publish-subscribe communication pattern that provides real-time streaming of data such as sensor readings, joint states, or IMU data between nodes.

## V

**Vision-Language-Action Integration**: The convergence of computer vision, natural language processing, and robotic action systems, enabling robots to understand and execute commands based on visual input and linguistic instructions.

## Z

**Zero Moment Point (ZMP)**: A dynamic stability criterion used in humanoid robotics to maintain balance by keeping the point of force application within the support polygon of the robot's feet.
