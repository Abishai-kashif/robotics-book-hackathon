- Define module structure with chapter titles

### 5. Template and Process Creation
- Develop chapter content template with required sections
- Create constitution compliance checklist
- Establish quality assurance process document
- Define content contract validation script
- Create review and validation workflows

### 6. Chapter Content Development
- Research and define chapter topic with clear scope
- Create chapter content following established template
- Conduct academic source research (minimum 5 sources per chapter)
- Create examples directory with practical implementations
- Create exercises directory with varying difficulty levels
- Validate content meets constitution compliance requirements

## Quality Assurance Phase

### 7. Content Quality Review
- Create quality review checklists based on standards
- Review content for academic accuracy and technical compliance
- Verify pedagogical effectiveness standards
- Document quality assurance findings
- Implement revision process for non-compliant content

### 8. Content Integration and Consistency
- Create consistency review process document
- Compare terminology consistency across chapters
- Compare formatting consistency across all chapters
- Identify and resolve content gaps between chapters
- Ensure learning objectives build coherently
- Create glossary of consistent terminology
- Document and resolve identified inconsistencies

## Finalization Phase

### 9. Polish and Cross-Cutting Concerns
- Create comprehensive table of contents with learning objectives
- Verify all content meets minimum requirements (1,500 words per chapter)
- Ensure all chapters have required 3+ key concepts with detailed explanations
- Verify all chapters have at least 1 complete practical example
- Confirm all chapters have 2-5 exercises of varying difficulty
- Perform final constitution compliance verification
- Create assessment and evaluation guidelines
- Document the content creation process for future modules

### 10. Final Review and Integration Testing
- Perform comprehensive review of all module components
- Test content integration and cross-references
- Verify constitutional compliance across all content
- Validate learning progression and coherence
- Conduct final quality assurance check
- Document lessons learned and process improvements

## Standard Content Structure

### Chapter Template Components
Each chapter must include:
1. **Learning Objectives**: 5-6 specific, measurable objectives
2. **Introduction**: Context-setting and overview
3. **Key Concepts**: 3-4 detailed concepts with explanations
4. **Practical Examples**: 1-2 real-world applications
5. **Exercises**: 2-5 problems of varying difficulty
6. **Summary**: Key takeaways and connections
7. **Constitution Compliance Check**: Verification of all 8 principles

### Quality Standards
- Minimum 1,500 words per chapter
- 3-4 key concepts with detailed explanations
- 1-2 practical examples with implementation details
- 2-5 exercises covering different difficulty levels
- Academic rigor appropriate for university level
- Constitutional compliance with all 8 principles

## Constitutional Compliance Process

### 8 Core Principles Integration
1. **Physical AI First**: Connect AI systems to physical world
2. **ROS 2 Integration**: Use ROS 2 as middleware framework
3. **Sim2Real**: Include simulation before real-world concepts
4. **Multi-Platform**: Support NVIDIA Isaac, Gazebo, Unity
5. **Vision-Language-Action**: Integrate LLMs, vision, robotic action
6. **Humanoid-Centric**: Prioritize humanoid form factors
7. **Conversational AI**: Include GPT models or conversational components
8. **Hardware-Aware**: Acknowledge computational demands

### Compliance Verification Steps
1. Initial integration during content creation
2. Mid-process verification during quality review
3. Final verification before module completion
4. Documentation of compliance in each chapter

## Tools and Resources

### Required Tools
- Docusaurus for documentation framework
- Git for version control
- Markdown editors for content creation
- Academic research databases for source materials
- Quality assurance checklists and templates

### Standard Resources
- Chapter template in shared/templates/
- Constitution compliance checklist
- Quality assurance process document
- Citation management system
- Glossary of standardized terminology

## Process Variations

### Module-Specific Adaptations
While the core process remains consistent, adaptations may be needed for:
- Advanced technical modules requiring more depth
- Practical implementation modules requiring more examples
- Theoretical modules requiring more conceptual development
- Interdisciplinary modules requiring cross-referencing

### Quality Adjustments
- Academic rigor requirements may vary by module level
- Technical depth may vary based on prerequisites
- Practical examples may vary based on module focus
- Exercise complexity may vary based on learning objectives

## Success Metrics

### Content Quality Metrics
- Adherence to constitutional principles (100% compliance)
- Academic rigor appropriate for university level
- Consistency of terminology and concepts across modules
- Student engagement and comprehension indicators
